This property makes it a member of the rare group of emirps, which are prime numbers that remain prime when their digits are reversed. In fact, there are only 26 emirps less than 100,000, and 87149 is one of them. Additionally, 87149 is a safe prime, which means that it has the form 2p+1, where p is also a prime number.
