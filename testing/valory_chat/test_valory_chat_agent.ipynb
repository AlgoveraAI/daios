The key characteristics of agent services are that they are decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust. Open Autonomy provides command line tools and base packages to build, deploy, publish, and test these agent services. It aims to speed up the development life cycle of autonomous services and provides an ecosystem with an SDK, reward system for developers and operators, and a governance protocol."

The agent service uses a consensus gadget to synchronize the service state and reach consensus. It is crypto-economically secured on a public blockchain and is designed to be decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust. Agent services enable complex processing, can take action on their own, and run continuously. They can have proactive behaviors and execute off-chain logic without giving up decentralization. Examples of agent services include triggering specific actions on external events or executing machine learning models."
