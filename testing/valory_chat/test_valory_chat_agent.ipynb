It is decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust. An agent service is composed of multiple agents and is owned by an operator who manages the infrastructure. Each agent within the service has its own set of functionalities and implements different communication protocols. The core component inside an agent is the FSM app, which defines the business logic of the service. The internal state of an agent service is replicated across all agents through a consensus gadget. Agent services can perform complex, proactive behaviors and can interact with smart contracts. They are different from smart contracts, web services, and custom decentralized services in terms of their architecture and capabilities."
