       "2. Decentralization: Agent services in Open Autonomy are decentralized, meaning they operate without a central authority or control.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Finite-State Machine (FSM): The business logic of an agent service is described as a finite-state machine (FSM) specification. This specification defines the states of the service and how it transitions from one state to another.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Composability, Extensibility, and Reusability: Open Autonomy emphasizes the ability to compose, extend, and reuse components within the framework, allowing for flexible and modular development.\n",

Instead, the network parameters and governance protocols are voted on by the participants in the network. This decentralized approach allows for a more transparent and autonomous system where developers, operators, and users are all compensated for their work and have a say in the decision-making process."
